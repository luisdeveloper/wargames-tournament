# Versioning and Evolution

The API is currently in its first version.

At this stage, no explicit versioning strategy (such as URL-based versioning) is
implemented. The API is expected to evolve while maintaining backward
compatibility whenever possible.

## Backward Compatibility

Minor changes, such as adding new endpoints or extending existing response
payloads with additional fields, are considered backward compatible.

Breaking changes may include:
- Removing or renaming existing endpoints
- Changing the structure of request or response payloads
- Modifying business rules that affect existing behaviour

## Future Versioning Strategy

If breaking changes become necessary, a versioning strategy may be introduced,
such as:
- URL-based versioning (e.g. `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`)
- Header-based versioning

The chosen strategy will aim to minimize disruption for existing clients.
